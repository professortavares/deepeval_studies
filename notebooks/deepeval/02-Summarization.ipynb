    "1. **Encoding the source**\n",
    "   The model tokenizes and embeds the input, capturing semantic relations in its hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decoding with length control**\n",
    "   The decoder (or next-token predictor) is guided—via prompt instructions or tuned loss—to produce far fewer tokens than it consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attention filtering**\n",
    "   Self-attention helps the model decide which spans of the source warrant focus, enabling it to drop peripheral details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compression strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Extractive*: literally copy the most salient sentences/phrases.\n",
    "   * *Abstractive*: paraphrase and synthesize new sentences never seen verbatim in the source (the dominant method in modern LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt patterns that steer summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern                | Example                                                |\n",

    "| **Headline & tagline** | “Give me a newspaper headline and one-sentence blurb.” |\n",
    "| **Role-specific**      | “Explain this paper so a high-schooler gets it.”       |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Bottom line\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization with LLMs is *intelligent compression*: selectively re-expressing the essence of a text while striving to remain faithful. Abstractive LLMs outshine classic extractive methods in fluidity and adaptability, but they bring new challenges—chiefly factual drift—that must be countered with careful prompting, retrieval aids, and post-generation verification.\n"

       "Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire, to Hermann and Pauline Einstein. His parents were both Jewish, and his father was an engineer and salesman. Einstein's early life was marked by a curious and imaginative childhood, which laid the foundation for his future scientific endeavors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Education and Career**\n",
       "\n",
       "Einstein studied physics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic University in Zurich, where he graduated in 1900 with a degree in physics. He then worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, where he evaluated patents related to electrical and mechanical inventions. During this period, Einstein developed his theory of special relativity, which posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another.\n",
       "\n",
       "In 1905, a \"miracle year\" in which Einstein published four groundbreaking papers, including his famous equation E=mc². This paper introduced the concept of mass-energy equivalence and revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and matter.\n",

       "**Main Achievements**\n",
       "\n",
       "Einstein's main achievements include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Theory of Special Relativity (1905)**: Introduced the concept of time dilation, length contraction, and relativity of simultaneity.\n",
       "2. **Theory of General Relativity (1915)**: Described gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. This theory predicted phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves.\n",
       "3. **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²)**: Demonstrated that mass and energy are interchangeable, with equal amounts of each being equivalent to a certain amount of energy.\n",
       "4. **Photons and the Photoelectric Effect**: Showed that light is composed of particles called photons, which have both wave-like and particle-like properties.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Legacy**\n",
       "\n",
       "Einstein's work had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe, from the smallest subatomic particles to the vast expanse of cosmological scales. His theories of relativity revolutionized physics, astronomy, and engineering, influencing fields such as quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics.\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout his life, Einstein was known for his passion for peace, civil rights, and social justice. He was a vocal advocate for these causes, often using his fame to raise awareness about important issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Personal Life**\n",
       "\n",
       "Einstein married Mileva Marić in 1903, with whom he had two sons, Hans Albert and Eduard. The couple divorced in 1919. Einstein then married Elsa Löwenthal in 1919, who remained his wife until her death in 1936. He was known for his love of music, particularly violin, and enjoyed playing the violin to relax.\n",
       "\n",
